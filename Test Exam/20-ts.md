# Structural Typing

In the context of TypeScript's type system, mark the below statements about the sendOrderConfirmation function as true or false.

```ts
type Order = {
    id: string
    product: string
    quantity: number
}

function sendOrderConfirmation(order: Order) {
    console.log(`Your order (${order.quantity} x ${order.product}) has been confirmed with order number ${order.id}.`)
}
```

1. The function will only accept objects that explicitly implement the Order type.
2. The function will only accept objects that extend the Order type.
3. The function will accept any object that have the same properties as the Order where the property types match the property types on the Order type.
4. The function will accept any object that have the same property names as the Order, regardless of the declared types of the properties.
